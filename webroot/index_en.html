                            <h2>General information</h2>
							Welcome to the webpage of the first chaos party Ulm(CPU)! The CPU is a small chaos event in the Mensa of the University of Ulm for Erfas, ChaosTreffs, hackerspaces, people close to the chaos and in general every humanoid life form that is interested in the event. We offer a hackcenter to sit around with each other and to talk about all imaginable topics. There is also a smaller workshop and seminar room in which we organise a lecture programme. Based on our name, our lectures and workshops are more in the hardware technology direction, but we will also have lectures on other topics.

	In addition to the tickets for the entire event, we will also offer day tickets, which you can purchase on site.
                       <h2>Catering</h2>
							Since the university is a bit remote, we offer a daily breakfast, as is usual at chaos events, as well as a dinner on Fridays and a lunch and dinner on Saturdays. Meals include meat as well as vegetarian and vegan dishes. The more detailed meal schedule will also be published here on the website shortly before the event. 
                            <h2>Lodging</h2>
                            Unfortunately there are no overnight accommodations at the event itself.                            
                            <!--<h2>Fringe events</h2>
							We plan to officially open the event at about 8pm on Friday. The schedule for the workshops and lectures will be published here soon. Furthermore, we are planning to organize a musical ending of the evening with DJs close to chaos like couchsofa.

						<h2>Program</h2>
						As previously announced, there will also be workshops and lectures on the CPU. We will offer workshops on the following topics: FPGA, soldering and micro origami. There will also be a presentation on Coreboot followed by a workshop. We will also offer two lectures. One of them is entitled "My home, my apartment, my hacker space - everything under one roof, or what do I really need". We'll also allow some time for lighthningtalks, so if you have a great project you want to introduce, you're welcome to introduce it there. A calendar with the exact lecture times will be published in the course of the next few days. Besides the lectures and workshops there will also be a ctf starting Saturday morning.
